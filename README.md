This isn't a normal README. 

This README is more like one of those Indiana Jones jungle temples, but filled with tales of learning quests and links to mysterious repos. 

TL;DR It’s a tangled treasure-trove of remote dev collaborations, of various sorts. 

This projects playlist is a living and ever-growing ode to people coming together to learn and build. Each project represents strangers from across the world who came together to create something.

The moonshot? 1000 projects to this list by 2020. 

We live, we learn, we build. 

Note: I am presently reaching out to teams and people involved in the projects below to get more specific details. Consider this wild list as a work-in-progress. If I've missed anything (almost guaranteed that I have), please DM me to let me know :)

That's what the #resources channel in the cohorts is like, and after awhile it can be a little too amazing. Sometimes people think: "how can I keep all of these resources?" The resources buffet was a response to that.

## 2 -> [Patakey Sound app](https://jadczakd.github.io/patakeyboard/) 

**Project Description**: Patatapclone with soundtable looping. 

**Project Story**: This project holds a dear spot in my heart of hearts. At this point Chingu consisted of maybe 3 cohorts (Raccoons, Foxes, Rhinos). Around this time, @jadczakd was just on fire in the cohorts. He was right into the mix learning every day, ignighting discussions and code chats left and right. This man used to involved in the circus - he's got a firey spirit and can juggle like no one's business. 

He'd been working on the patakey app for awhile, and if I recall there was some kind of discussion between him and @vin16 about the app (vin's used to be a hip hop beat maker). 

Anyways, @jadczakd dropped the Patakey project on the FCC forum for a little review and what happened next had me feeling pretty damned inspired. Another member in a different cohort saw his post, and was moved enough that he posted it in his cohort saying something along the lines of "now THIS is inspiring." He had no idea the creator was in another cohort. I just about lost it! It was one of the first times I witnessed first hand the power of how action inspires more action. When we build, we build to learn, but in the right context, we can inspire others to strive for more as well. 

So, the Patakey app wasn't a team project, but it demands a place on this list nonetheless.

## 1 -> [Chingu cohorts begin](https://chingu-cohorts.github.io/chingu-directory/)

**Project Description**: We group motivated individuals with shared goals together to learn and build. 

**Project Story**: I'd just made what was an extremely difficult decision (at the time) to pull out of a coding bootcamp. I was going to code full time using FCC and other online resources. I enjoyed the group vibe in the bootcamp precourse so I put a call out in the FreeCodeCamp forum. I was hoping at least 10 or so people would respond to it. About 25 people did, and off we went.

## 20 -> [GAME-DEV PROJECT MANAGEMENT WEB-APP](https://chingu-game-dev.herokuapp.com/) 

**Project Description**: Project Management Site for the Game-Dev Project

**Project Story**: So… @kimkwanka reached out to ask if she could make a game-development project, and I replied that that would be wonderful!

Little did I know, (@kimkwanka is an absolute *legend*) a few weeks later there was 80+ people split amongst 21 teams and A FULL BLOWN PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL WITH SLACK INTEGRATION built and implemented.

At the time of writing the projects just kicked off… what.a.time.to.be.alive!

## 5 -> [RAMBUNCTIOUS RHINOS SPACE SHOOTER](http://trion.me/Space-Shooter/)

**Project Description**: Reverse-engineering of the old-school arcade game Space Invaders!

**Project Story**: This project started out as a little seed of an idea based on a resource someone posted in the #general chat, and grew into a wild jungle of an adventure with people from damned near every continent working together to build a classic arcade game…WHAT?! (ya I know, we’re not normal ;p)
 
We kicked off the first project meeting with…around 20 people! We rallied around one version of the game and collectively managed to get a features list set and loaded up in Trello (project management tool). Those features were translated into tasks and we formed pairs to work on the tasks.

With the amount of people we had working on that project, it’s a miracle anything got finished. It was a fun ride, though!

**Project Leads**: @trion, the Emoji-Sensai himself!
