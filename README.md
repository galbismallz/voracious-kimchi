This isn't a normal README. 

This README is more like one of those Indiana Jones jungle temples, but filled with tales of learning quests and links to mysterious repos. 

TL;DR It’s a tangled treasure-trove of remote dev collaborations, of various sorts. 

This projects playlist is a living and ever-growing ode to people coming together to learn and build. Each project represents strangers from across the world who came together to create something.

The moonshot? 1000 projects to this list by 2020. 

We live, we learn, we build. 

Note: I am presently reaching out to teams and people involved in the projects below to get more specific details. Consider this wild list as a work-in-progress. If I've missed anything (almost guaranteed that I have), please DM me to let me know :)

## 16 -> [New Year Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ82dreEaXU) 

**Project Description**: Something like 15-20 different people from different countries wishing everyone a Happy New Year (in English and often in their native language as well). It's a showcase of the diversity of the Chingus. 

**Project Story**: To be honest, I'm not sure how this idea came about, but I'm sure glad it did. My guess is it was @alecia's idea :). Alecia and I chatted with members who were interested in participating and we got several short video clips of people showcasing their homeland and droppin some "Happy New Years" salutations. Then we sent the clips to the illustrious @oansky who did a fine job mix-mastering that into a coherent showcase. 

**Project Leads**: @alecial, @oansky 

## 15 -> [Pair-board](http://pairboard.surge.sh/) 

**Project Description**: Pair programming connector for Freecodecamp. 

**Project Story**: Quick disclaimer: this project was not born from the cohorts. As far as I know, this project was inspired by one of @p1xt's awesome dev challenges on the Freecodecamp forum. I add it here because @jacksonbates brought the project into the cohorts (shout-out r-pandas!) and quite a few peple contributed to it from there. Even now, if you go to this page you'll see one of @kornil's favicons on the tab. :)

**Project Leads**: @jacksonbates, (see link below for the full honour roll!)

## 14 -> [Chuzzlehunt Need link - NEED LINK](#) 

**Project Description**: Part coding challenge, part internet adventure, part treasure hunt. 

**Project Story**: This project was so fun to see start as an idea and then grow into something people got to interact with and have fun with. The emoji sensai himself (@trion) likes puzzles and loves code, so he put the idea together and we got it rollin'! 

We partnered this project with another project - the New Years video - and the rest is history. I've heard whispers that the Chuzzlehunt Part 2 is in the works. And what a coincidence, we've also go the second video in the works... :)

**Project Leads**: 

## 13 -> [Kornil's Favicons begin](https://github.com/Kornil/Red-Panda-FCC-Favicon) 

**Project Description**: Animal favicons for each Chingu cohort. 

**Project Story**: This is one of those projects that start off as a seed, and then grow into the wild into all kinds of fun and interesting ways as people interact with it. Kornil originally made a favicon for his Red-Pandas, and then suddenly people started adding the favicons to their profile pictures in the cohorts and the Freecodecamp forum.

Since then, it's become a tradition: new cohort = new kornil favicon! 

**Project Leads**: @kornil

## 12 -> Florinpop's wild week 

**Project Story**:The infamous Week of Florinpop back in the Meerkat days! During this week, @florinpop rampaged through what seemed like 1200 projects. In reality, he built a single player football game (x-ball), a multiplayer football game (x-ball), a chat-application and a snakemaze-type game. Oh, and he also had his multiplayer version of x-ball showcased on a famous Javascript youtube channel (in picture below).  

No joke, people mentioned florinpop and kornil on the post-cohort survey comment section, saying how seeing others so active inspired them to build and learn more. This is what it's all about!

**Publication(s)** <br> 

**Project Leads**: @florinpop, @meerkats who brought that motivational fuel!

## 222322 -> [User-name Generator](http://trion.me/CodingChallenges/Tools/UsernameGenerator/) 

**Project Description**: This splendid little functionality generates groovy usernames. We should probably start using this for build.to.learn team project names... ;p

**Project Story**: A pair-programming adventure!

**Publication(s)** <br> 

**Project Leads**: @trion, @sagark


## 11 -> [Pear](https://github.com/mmhansen/pear) 

**Project Description**: Full on remote dev project streamlining app!

**Project Story**: This idea started somewhat as a joke about making a "tinder for projects". It didn't end up being that, but it is a tool to help streamline team projects. @mmhansen beasted this project pretty much single-handedly, and pretty much set the path towards legendary status by doing it. Not long after this project, @mmhansen got his first javascript dev job! :)

**Project Leads**: @mmhansen

## 5 -> [RAMBUNCTIOUS RHINOS SPACE SHOOTER](http://trion.me/Space-Shooter/)

**Project Description**: Reverse-engineering of the old-school arcade game Space Invaders!

**Project Story**: This project started out as a little seed of an idea based on a resource someone posted in the #general chat, and grew into a wild jungle of an adventure with people from damned near every continent working together to build a classic arcade game…WHAT?! (ya I know, we’re not normal ;p)
 
We kicked off the first project meeting with…around 20 people! We rallied around one version of the game and collectively managed to get a features list set and loaded up in Trello (project management tool). Those features were translated into tasks and we formed pairs to work on the tasks.

With the amount of people we had working on that project, it’s a miracle anything got finished. It was a fun ride, though!

**Project Leads**: @trion, the Emoji-Sensai himself!

## 9 -> [Momentum (sparta & gang)](http://rawgit.com/Bigghead/Momentum-Clone/master/index.html) 

**Project Description**: A suave reverse-engineering of the productivity app called Momentum-dash. 

**Project Story**: This was an organically grown project pretty much. A few people messaged about wanting to get into a remote dev team project. A previous team had courageously attempted the Momentum adventure didn't finish it, so that idea was chosen. Like all team projects, there was some challenges but the team rallied beautifully and completed the FIRST MOMENTUM PROJECT!

**Project Leads**: @mozar, @sparta, @thelittleblacksmith (shout-out to everyone else who worked on this project as well!)

## 8 -> Campfire Stories Version 1 

**Project Description**: Campfire-stories captures and showcases the stories of people coding around the world. Like Humans of New York, but for devs.  

**Project Story**: "this is why I code" comment on the forum post

**Publication(s)** <br> 
[@alecia's article called "Initiating a conversation is terrifying"](https://medium.com/chingu/initiating-a-conversation-is-terrifying-b4dd922640b3) about her experience working on this project.

**Project Leads**: @mmhansen, @codejunky, @l-emi, @alecia, @serio-cielo, and a whole lot of other people I've still got to track down... ;p 

## 7 -> Campfire stories' logo 

**Project Description**: @sergio-cielo worked on the Campfire-stories design and crafted this wonderful logo for it! 

**Project Leads**: @sergio-cielo

## 345336 -> [The Weekly Update is born](https://medium.com/chingu/chingu-weekly-vol-20-71c061968fc7) 

**Project Description**: A weekly soiree-on-the-screen that showcases the happens within the cohorts each week. Team and individual projects, stories, Chingu-of-the-Week, News, etc. 

**Project Story**: This started partly for the same reason this projects playlist repo exists; namely, there's too much awesome stuff going on not to share. 

**Publication(s)** <br> 


## 6 -> [Chingu Youtube Channel aka @mmhansen's tutorial fiesta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwrd-JCOzd4) 

**Project Description**: Youtube channel for tutorials, talks or Campfire-Stories specific videos (like the New Years video or the upcoming global perspectives video asking "why is coding important to you?")

**Project Story**: This started from @mmhansen wanting to explore and learn about making coding tutorials. 

**Project Leads**: @mmhansen

## 5 -> [DUMA](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duma/mamoofifhahehmokjnkpdkoojkcliimc) 

**Project Description**: Duma is a simple, clean word-of-the-day app. It fetches a new word and its definition everyday, and comes with a series of beautiful backgrounds provided by Unsplash. Install to expand your vocabulary and prettify your New Tab page! 

**Project Story**: This project was a pivot inspired by the first build.to.learn project team l-emi was in (though we weren’t calling it build.to.learn then). The Momentum project team she was involved in didn’t end up finishing, but it ended up inspiring someone to create something else, which as you’ll see is a fairly common with the Momentum project.

## 4 -> [Resources Buffet](https://trello.com/b/qwafTxsu/resource1) 

**Project Description**: A plentiful buffet of wev-dev resources, all in one trello. Oh, and lots of turtles. ;p

**Project Story**: Imagine a refreshing waterfall. Now imagine instead of water, pouring down that waterfall was wonderful web-dev resources! That's what the #resources channel in the cohorts is like, and after awhile it can be a little too amazing. Sometimes people think: "how can I keep all of these resources?" The resources buffet was a response to that.

**Project Story**: This illustrious little codepen was created during a pair-programming session many moons ago!

**Project Leads**: @kunal05, @trion 

## 2 -> [Patakey Sound app](https://jadczakd.github.io/patakeyboard/) 

**Project Description**: Patatapclone with soundtable looping. 

**Project Story**: This project holds a dear spot in my heart of hearts. At this point Chingu consisted of maybe 3 cohorts (Raccoons, Foxes, Rhinos). Around this time, @jadczakd was just on fire in the cohorts. He was right into the mix learning every day, ignighting discussions and code chats left and right. This man used to involved in the circus - he's got a firey spirit and can juggle like no one's business. 

He'd been working on the patakey app for awhile, and if I recall there was some kind of discussion between him and @vin16 about the app (vin's used to be a hip hop beat maker). 

Anyways, @jadczakd dropped the Patakey project on the FCC forum for a little review and what happened next had me feeling pretty damned inspired. Another member in a different cohort saw his post, and was moved enough that he posted it in his cohort saying something along the lines of "now THIS is inspiring." He had no idea the creator was in another cohort. I just about lost it! It was one of the first times I witnessed first hand the power of how action inspires more action. When we build, we build to learn, but in the right context, we can inspire others to strive for more as well. 

So, the Patakey app wasn't a team project, but it demands a place on this list nonetheless.

## 1 -> [Chingu cohorts begin](https://chingu-cohorts.github.io/chingu-directory/)

**Project Description**: We group motivated individuals with shared goals together to learn and build. 

**Project Story**: I'd just made what was an extremely difficult decision (at the time) to pull out of a coding bootcamp. I was going to code full time using FCC and other online resources. I enjoyed the group vibe in the bootcamp precourse so I put a call out in the FreeCodeCamp forum. I was hoping at least 10 or so people would respond to it. About 25 people did, and off we went.
